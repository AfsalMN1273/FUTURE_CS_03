# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System (AES-256)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Secure File Sharing System** developed as part of **Task 3 – Cyber Security Internship**.  
The application allows users to **upload and download files securely**, ensuring that files are **encrypted at rest** using **AES-256 encryption** and only decrypted during download.

The project demonstrates secure file handling, encryption implementation, and basic secure web application development.
